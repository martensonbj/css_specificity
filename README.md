## Main Ideas
* We are all here to learn back end development, but inevitably we will also be thrown into situations where we have to figure out why our front end looks like crap. CSS is the meat behind the HTML skeleton and I'd like to go over some of the more obvious pitfalls when starting to explore design.

* Additionally, one of the most useful and important tools when writing front-end code is the Inspect Element option in developer tools. I've also noticed that it is one of the most commonly overlooked resources when troubleshooting front-end issues. I'll walk through some of the aspects of this tool that I use most frequently.

## Covered Topics
* What is CSS and why is it named CSS?
* What is Specificity?
